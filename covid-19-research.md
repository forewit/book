Notes on Covid-19 vaccines including sources and discovery method.

&nbsp;
## Expected vaccine efficacy and effects on transmission (pre-vaccine)
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine transmission" > first result
- **Source:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505651/
- **Caveats (personal):** this article was written prior to release of the vaccines. but I do agree with the conclusion
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** Notwithstanding these caveats [see article], COVID-19 vaccines are needed, even if they have minimal impact on transmission and despite the challenges of vaccine allocation. What such vaccines are likely to achieve might not be herd immunity. If so, strategies for how we use such vaccines would have to be based on other considerations. Will vaccines that protect healthy young adults also protect groups vulnerable to severe disease such as older adults and those with comorbidities? Influenza vaccines are less effective in older populations than in younger populations, partly due to immune senescence,23 which might similarly affect COVID-19 vaccines. However, the so-called original antigenic sin in influenza vaccines that arises from sequential infections by or vaccinations with antigenically closely related strains24 is not relevant to coronaviruses. If COVID-19 vaccines have acceptable effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups, they would have an important role, irrespective of impact on transmission and population immunity. If high-risk populations can be shielded by vaccination, COVID-19 control measures could be recalibrated. Crucially, it will be important to communicate to policy makers and the general public that first-generation vaccines are only one tool in the overall public health response to COVID-19 and unlikely to be the ultimate solution that many expect.
- **Takeaway:** a corona virus vaccine could be effective in prevention of hospitalization (most effective in vulnerable groups) even if it may not reduce transmission

## Vaccine efficacy verification (post-vaccine)
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine efficacy" > filter by written in 2021 > first result
- **Source:** https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107659
- **Caveats:** none
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020-004123-16. opens in new tab.)
- **Takeaway:** Verification of of the first takeaway: the current vaccine is effective in preventing hospitalization. 

## Discussion on vaccine early approval
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine early approval" > filter by written in 2021 > first result
- **Source:** https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M20-7357
- **Caveats:** none
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** the paper is short and does not offer a summary conclusion. 
- **Takeaway:** General disposition is that vaccines are useful, but concerns are raised that long-term effects are unknown.

## Discussion on vaccine safety
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine safety" > filter by written in 2021 > second result (first was related to early monitoring)
- **Source:** https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2104983 for a similar conclusion & takeaway, see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X2100284X
- **Caveats:** This study focused on pregnant people
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** Preliminary findings did not show obvious safety signals among pregnant persons who received mRNA Covid-19 vaccines. However, more longitudinal follow-up, including follow-up of large numbers of women vaccinated earlier in pregnancy, is necessary to inform maternal, pregnancy, and infant outcomes.
- **Takeaway:** long term studies (neccesarily) have not been done.

## CDC Announcement about the Delta Varriant:
- **Source:** https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/variants/delta-variant.html#:~:text=ly%20vaccinated%20people%20with%20asymptomatic,unvaccinated%20people.%20This%20means
- **Takeaway:** vaccines do not prevent transmission entirely (especially from variant infections). However, vaccinated people appear to be infectious for a shorter period. That said one of the sources cited in this announcement specifically states that efficacy numbers should be "interpreted with caution". See the summary paragraph of: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01358-1/fulltext

# General conclusion
> The vaccine has been effective in preventing hospitalization and severe symptoms, especially with early varients of Covid-19 and in at-risk population groups. However, there are many unknowns (especially regarding long-term impacts) and more information comming daily. Even sources cited by the CDC mention that efficacy numbers should be interpreted with caution.
> 
> Also, much like the influenza the CDC has announced that booster shots will likely be neccessary to maintain a high level of protection (see: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html).
