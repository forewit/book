# Learning what I can...
Notes on basic research into Covid-19 including notes on my lookup process.

### Expected vaccine efficacy and effects on transmission (pre-vaccine)
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine transmission" > first result
- **Source:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7505651/
- **Caveats (personal):** this article was written prior to release of the vaccines. but I do agree with the conclusion
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** Notwithstanding these caveats [see article], COVID-19 vaccines are needed, even if they have minimal impact on transmission and despite the challenges of vaccine allocation. What such vaccines are likely to achieve might not be herd immunity. If so, strategies for how we use such vaccines would have to be based on other considerations. Will vaccines that protect healthy young adults also protect groups vulnerable to severe disease such as older adults and those with comorbidities? Influenza vaccines are less effective in older populations than in younger populations, partly due to immune senescence,23 which might similarly affect COVID-19 vaccines. However, the so-called original antigenic sin in influenza vaccines that arises from sequential infections by or vaccinations with antigenically closely related strains24 is not relevant to coronaviruses. If COVID-19 vaccines have acceptable effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality in high-risk groups, they would have an important role, irrespective of impact on transmission and population immunity. If high-risk populations can be shielded by vaccination, COVID-19 control measures could be recalibrated. Crucially, it will be important to communicate to policy makers and the general public that first-generation vaccines are only one tool in the overall public health response to COVID-19 and unlikely to be the ultimate solution that many expect.
- **Takeaway:** a corona virus vaccine could be effective in prevention of hospitalization (most effective in vulnerable groups) even if it may not reduce transmission

## Vaccine efficacy verification (post-vaccine)
- **Search path:** Scholar.google.com > Search "Covid-19 vaccine efficacy" > filter by written in 2021 > first result
- **Source:** https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2107659
- **Caveats:** none
- **Conclusion (in it's entirety):** A two-dose regimen of the NVX-CoV2373 vaccine administered to adult participants conferred 89.7% protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection and showed high efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant. (Funded by Novavax; EudraCT number, 2020-004123-16. opens in new tab.)
- **Takeaway:** Verification of of the first takeaway: the current vaccine is effective in preventing hospitalization.
